<div class="list">•  After a malfunction has been rectified, the malfunction memory must be erased with the aid of the M-MDS. Once the malfunction memory has been cleared, DTC P1000 then remains in the data memory. DTC P1000 is called the readiness code. The readiness code indicates that not all the monitoring systems have completed their tests since the malfunction memory was erased. The readiness code can only be cleared once all the tests by the individual monitoring systems have been successfully completed during a readiness trip. The vehicle must only returned to the customer after the readiness code has been cleared. Only then is it possible to provide assurance that the vehicle is normal.</div>
