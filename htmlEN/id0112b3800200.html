<div class="list">•  Never remove the cooling system cap or loosen the radiator drain plug while the engine is running, or when the engine and radiator are hot. Scalding engine coolant and steam may shoot out and cause serious injury. It may also damage the engine and cooling system.</div>
<div class="list">•  Turn off the engine and wait until it is cool. Even then, be very careful when removing the cap. Wrap a thick cloth around it and slowly turn it counterclockwise 2.5 turns. Step back while the pressure escapes.</div>
<div class="list">•  When you are sure all the pressure is gone, turn the cap using the cloth, and remove it.</div>
<div class="list">•  Depending on the vehicle, the cooling fan may operate suddenly even when the ignition switch is turned off. Therefore, keep hands and tools away from the cooling fan even if the cooling fan is not operating to prevent injury to personnel or damage to the cooling fan. Always disconnect the negative battery cable when servicing the cooling fan or parts near the cooling fan.</div>
